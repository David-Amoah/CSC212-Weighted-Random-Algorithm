# CSC212-Weighted-Random-Algorithm
This is an implementation of a weighed random algorithm in python for a create3 iRobot Roomba.

This is a research project which uses a Weighted Random Algorithm. It works by assigning numeric values to different objects and randomly picks one. Objects with higher 
values are more likely to be chosen. 

## Usage Instructions
**1. Initialization:**
      *Before using weighted random algortithm, ensure that your robot is powered on and ready for operation.
      *Ensure that robot is equipped with required sensors responsible for navigation.
