# CSC212-Weighted-Random-Algorithm
This is an implementation of a weighed random algorithm in python for a create3 iRobot Roomba.

This is a research project which uses a Weighted Random Algorithm. It works by assigning numeric values to different objects and randomly picks one. Objects with higher 
values are more likely to be chosen. 

## Hardware
Hardware Components
- Create 3 Roomba
- Raspberrypi 4
- Lidar sensor

## Software
- Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS 2
- NAV 2

## Usage Instructions
**1. Initialization:**  
- Before using weighted random algortithm, ensure that your robot is powered on and ready for operation.  
- Ensure that robot is equipped with required sensors responsible for navigation.
