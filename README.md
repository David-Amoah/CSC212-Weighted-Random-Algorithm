# CSC212-Weighted-Random-Algorithm
This is an implementation of a weighed random algorithm in python for a create3 iRobot Roomba.

This is a research project which uses a Weighted Random Algorithm. It works by assigning numeric values to different objects and randomly picks one. Objects with higher 
values are more likely to be chosen. In the implementation code, we begin by importing all the necessary packages and modules.
