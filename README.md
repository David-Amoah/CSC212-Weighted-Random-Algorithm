# CSC212-Weighted-Random-Algorithm
This is an implementation of a weighed random algorithm in python for a create3 iRobot Roomba.

This is a research project which uses a Weighted Random Algorithm. It works by assigning numeric values to different objects and randomly picks one. Objects with higher 
values are more likely to be chosen. 

## Hardware
- Create 3 Roomba
- Raspberrypi 4
- Lidar sensor

## Software
- Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS 2
- NAV 2

## User Manual 
- Before using weighted random algortithm, ensure that your robot is powered on and ready for operation.  
- Ensure that robot is equipped with required sensors responsible for navigation.  (Lidar)
- Download Ros2 on a raspberry pi running on Ubuntu 22.04. [Link Here](https://docs.ros.org/en/crystal/Installation/Linux-Install-Binary.html)
- Install Nav 2 by running this command in the terminal.
  
  > $ sudo apt install ros-humble-navigation2 ros-humble-nav2-bringup
